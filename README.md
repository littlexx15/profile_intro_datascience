# Environment Setup and Dependency Installation  

To ensure consistency and portability, it is highly recommended to create an isolated Python environment before installing the project dependencies.  

## Using Conda  

- Create a new Conda environment

    ```sh  
    conda create -n data_science python=3.10  
    ```  

- Activate the environment:  

    ```sh  
    conda activate data_science  
    ```  

## Using Virtualenv  

- Create a virtual environment:  

    ```sh  
    python -m venv env  
    ```  

- Activate the virtual environment:  

  - On macOS and Linux:  

    ```sh  
    source env/bin/activate  
    ```  

  - On Windows:  

    ```sh  
    env\Scripts\activate  
    ```  

## Installing Dependencies  

All required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:  

```sh  
pip install -r requirements.txt
